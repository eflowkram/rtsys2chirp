## rtsys2chirp
This is a little program I whipped up to convert a csv exported from rt systems programming software
and allow for import on chirp.  Mostly just mapping columns and dropping stuff that chirp didn't have.
Also had to map values between Rt Systems like "FM Narrow" to "NFM" and things like that.   I have the ftm400, ftm500
and ft3dr RT systems software.  I was trying to program some memories on an ft857 I picked up, so the evening spent doing this was easier than manually programming the radio. 

## Requires Python 3.10 or newer
